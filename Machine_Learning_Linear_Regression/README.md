# Machine_Learning_Linear_Regression

An implementation of bayesian linear regression on a 2D data set, first using linear bases to approximate a noisy line, then using a set of 9 Gaussian basis functions to approximate a noisy sine function. For the noisy line, multivariate normal distributions on both the likelihood and the prior/posterior are illustrated as the number of samples is increased. For the noisy sine function, the estimated mean and standard deviation of the function are illustrated as the number of samples is increased.
